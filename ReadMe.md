You pilot an orange fighter ship along the bottom of the screen, moving left and right and firing lasers to fend off three escalating waves of alien attackers.

Wave 1 delivers fast‐moving “monkey” projectiles from beige fighters.

Wave 2 unleashes larger, slower “elephant” shots from blue ships.

Wave 3 is a hulking yellow mothership boss that rains both monkeys and elephants and takes three laser hits to destroy.

Along the way you track your score (points for each ship destroyed, minus points if you get hit), manage a 10‐point health bar (icons for each HP), earn health bonuses for streaks, and—when you win or lose—see a final summary and can click to restart.
